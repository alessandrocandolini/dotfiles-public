# Nix

## Why nix?

[Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) is a *purely functional* cross-platform package manager aiming at *reproducible builds*.

Generally speaking, there are many intriguing applications of nix, including: 
* **throwaway ephemeral shells**: do you want to access `sbt` (the scala build tool) but you don't want to install it global? Just run `nix-shell -p sbt` 
* **dev environment setup on a per-repo / per-project basis**, avoiding global installations and/or per-shell environment managers like pyenv, jenv etc; you `cd` into a project folder and all the right dependnecies becomes available

Ephemeral reproducible enviroments can be achieved alternatively through Dockerised environments, but there is a overhead of RAM, CPU, etc to setup docker containers for every usecase. 
In addition, nix can be used to generate smaller minimal Docker images. 

Here however I want to focus on another interesting aspect of nix, namely using nix as a package manager (essentially, on MACOSX as an alternative to homebrew). 
Why? 
If you are familiar with infrastructure as code, the following should sound familiar. 
Essentially, we want the possibility to declare programmatically which software is available in our local machine.
the advantages are riproducibility, portability, and the fact that the configuration of your machine is defined in code and can be handled using a source management system. 
This also opens the door the other possibilities, like rollbacks. 

To achieve this we will need to install two / three things 
* nix itself
* nix-darwing 
* home-manager (optional, I don't use it) 


## Installation 

###Â Install Nix

I'll focus on MACOSX, because that's the platform that i usually use for my work and because it's a tricky one (in latest versions). 

Latest guide should be available here: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sect-macos-installation
```
$  sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume
```

Nix by default pretends to create a folder under `/nix` which creates problems on latest versions of macosx. You might need to 
```
sudo diskutil apfs addVolume diskXXX APFS 'Nix Store' -mountpoint /nix
```

You need to source some nix files in your .bashrc file, see `.bashrc` file in this repo. 

### Install nix darwin

It can be installed using `nix`, once nix is installed. However the installer fails due to the need of creating a symb link on `/run`. 
The solution is to edit 
```
12:50 $ cat /etc/synthetic.conf
nix
run     /System/Volumes/Data/private/var/run/
```

and to **reboot** the machine in order the changes to become effective. You might also need to run 
```
 /System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs.util -t
 ```
